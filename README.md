# E Commerce Platform - Shoppee

Backend part is added to `.gitignore` due to security.

## Fuctions Implemented

1. Search by keyword/category
   Our platform could search by both key word and category, and will return a page cannot found if not found anything.
2. Shopping cart
   ![Checkout Page](/project_showcase/ShoppingCart.PNG)
   We can increment/decrement the Quantity of our product by clicking +/-.
   We can also remove the product from our shopping cart by clicking remove button.
3. Pagination    
   
   ![Pagination](/project_showcase/Pagination.PNG)
   We added a feature by angular to let customer select how much item they want for each page, and button with boarders (max page show will be 5).
